Goddamn "C for Rendering"
=========================
_Copyright (C) Goddamn Industries 2016. All Rights Reserved._

Reincarnation of once well known shading language.
--------------------------------------------------
"**C** for **Rendering**" (or **Cr** for short) is an attempt to re-implement Nvidia's "**C** for
**Graphics**" framework, that was discontinued long time ago, in modern fashion for a slightly
different purpose.

In 2016 with more than many graphical APIs available, so cross-platform (and cross-API) rendering
software requires a single shading language that covers them all. This is why we are here,
tired of rewriting shaders once again, from **HLSL** to **GLSL**, from **GLSL** to **Metal** and
so on.



Language specification.
--------------------------------------------------
**Cr** is ~~a disabled child of **Cg** and **HLSL**~~ a shading language based on specification
of both **Cg** and modern **HLSL**.
It has similar to **ANSI C** syntax with several limitations and enhancements...
